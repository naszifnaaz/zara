              We work with monitoring programmes to ensure compliance with
              safety, health and quality standards for our products.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Green to Wear 2.0 standard aims to minimise the environmental
              impact of textile manufacturing. To that end, we have developed
              Inditex’s The List programme, which helps guarantee both that
              production processes are clean and that our garments are safe and
              healthy

            <p>Caring for your clothes is caring for the environment.</p>

            <p>
              To keep your jackets and coats clean, you only need to freshen
              them up and go over them with a cloth or a clothes brush. If you
              need to dry clean a garment, look for a dry cleaner that uses
              technologies that are respectful of the environment.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2 class="head">ORIGIN</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              We work alongside our suppliers, workers, unions and international
              bodies to develop a supply chain that respects and promotes human
              rights, contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development
              Goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, thanks to an ongoing collaboration with our
              suppliers, we have developed a tracking programme that allows us
              to determine where and how our products are being made.
